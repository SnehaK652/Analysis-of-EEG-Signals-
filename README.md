# Analysis-of-EEG-Signals
✨Understanding the Impact of Meditation and Concentration 🧠

Analysis of EEG signal changes during and after meditation, comparing practitioners and non-practitioners to identify brain regions and frequency bands linked to improved concentration, using FFT and linear regression.

This repository contains a project that analyzes EEG signal changes during and after meditation to investigate the impact of meditation on concentration. The study compares practitioners and non-practitioners, identifying brain regions and frequency bands associated with enhanced focus and cognitive function.

⭐Key Features:

🔸EEG Signal Analysis:

Utilized FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to analyze frequency components of EEG signals.
Applied linear regression to study correlations between EEG activity and concentration levels.

🔸Meditation vs. Non-Meditation Comparison:

Compared EEG patterns of meditation practitioners and non-practitioners to identify key differences in brain activity.
Highlighted brain regions and frequency bands linked to improved concentration.

🔸Machine Learning with Scikit-learn:

Fitted regression models for prediction and performance evaluation.
Performed residual analysis to calculate concentration levels.

🔸Data Visualization:

Visualized EEG signal patterns, model predictions, and analysis results using Matplotlib.

The above figure a) and b) consists of Frequency vs PSD c) Regression line d) Residual plot and e) regression parameters which indicates a more alert mind state, resulting in more frequent alpha waves in the brain.

🔸After Meditation:

The above figure a) and b) consists of Frequency vs PSD c) Regression line d) Residual plot and e) regression parameters which indicates a partially focused and partially alert mind state, resulting in both alpha and beta waves in the brain.

This project bridges neuroscience and machine learning to explore how meditation influences brain activity and enhances concentration.
